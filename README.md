# Loan Eligibility Prediction Model

## 1. Project Goal
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on the applicant's details. This project was completed as part of my internship at HexSoftwares.

## 2. Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "Loan Prediction" dataset, which contains various details about loan applicants.

## 3. Tools and Libraries Used
* **Python:** The core programming language.
* **Pandas & NumPy:** For data loading, manipulation, and cleaning.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
* **Scikit-learn:** For data preprocessing (scaling), model building (Logistic Regression), and evaluation.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** As the development environment.

## 4. Key Steps
* **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values in both numerical and categorical columns.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Converted categorical features to numerical using Label Encoding and scaled all features using StandardScaler.
* **Model Training:** Trained a Logistic Regression model on the preprocessed data.
* **Model Evaluation:** Achieved a final accuracy of [**Enter Your Final Accuracy Here, e.g., 80.33%**].

## 5. How to Run
1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install the required libraries from the list above.
3.  Run the Jupyter Notebook `Untitled-checkpoint.ipynb`.
